# CookReminder

Cook Reminder is a simple Android application that list all cook and remind you with the ones you didn't cook for a while. 
I wrote the app with Kotlin and designed the GUI with android studio. The project has two branches. 
The first one is using the Room database as a local database and does not need registration for use. 
The second one is using the Firebase Real-time Database to store data online and it needs registration for use and users can access their data from any other device.
